This docker image is meant to be ran interactively. Spin up a container and start an interactive session.
Then you must configure the AWS environment. It will look like this:

$ aws configure
aws_region_name: us-east-1
aws_access_key_id:  <>
aws_secret_access_key:  <>


Then use the script /opt/deploy-cloudformation-script.sh to
create a new batch environment.
